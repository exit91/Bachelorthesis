\subsubsection{invariance of singularities under a change of the system of partial derivatives}

Oftentimes it is more convenient to perform base changes to simplify equations and sometimes one can do without, bnut in exchange one needs to introduce more flexible tools.

Remember, in order to study singularities we introduced partial derivatives $\del_{x_i} : k[x_0,..x_n] \to k[x_0,..x_n]$ which satisfied $\del_{x_i}(x_j) = \delta_{i,j}$.
