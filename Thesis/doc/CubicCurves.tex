\subsection{Classification of singular cubic curves}

We will study the kinds of singularities which can occur for singular cubic curves.
Let $\V(F)$ be a singular cubic curve.
The first observation is that there exist only one singular point $P$ on the curve.
Assume for the contrary that $P \neq P'$ are singular points, then the restriction of $F$ to the line $L = \overline{P,P'}$ has 2 zeroes of multiplicity 2, but $F$ had degree 3 -- a contradiction.

\begin{todo}
\item relate singular points with lines through them
\end{todo}
