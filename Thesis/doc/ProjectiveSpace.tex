\subsection{projective space}

In order to do geometry we need to explain what points, lines, surfaces are.
There are several formulations of projective space, with varying degree of generality, and for our purposes I have chosen the one in terms of homogeneous coordinates.

Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field and $n$ a natural number.
Throughout this thesis, $k$ will always be an algebraically closed field.
The projective space $\proj^n_k$ is a topological space given as set by  $k^{n+1} - \{ 0 \}$ modulo the relation $X=(x_0,..x_n) \sim Y=(y_0,..y_n)$ if and only if $X$ and $Y$ are linearly dependent (as vectors in $k^{n+1}$). The equivalence class of $X$ will be denoted $[x_0:x_1:..:x_n]$.

The topology is given by the closed subsets
\begin{equation}
\V(I) =
\mkset{ [x_0:..x_n] \in \proj^n_k}
      { \forall f\in I \text{ homogeneous}, f(x_0,..x_n) = 0}
\end{equation}
for homogeneous ideals $I$ of the polynomial ring $k[x_0,..x_n]$.
The topology is known as Zariski's topology.
Because $k[x_0,..x_n]$ is a Noetherian ring, every ideal is finitely generated and in particular every homogeneous ideal is finitely generated by homogeneous elements.
So we may say that a closed set consists precisely of the points in projective space where a finite set of homogeneous ideals vanish.

In this framework we want to identify geometric objects with homogeneous ideals of $k[x_0,..x_n]$.
However, most of the time it is more natural to speak of the closed subsets of projective space, instead of the ideal $I$, and $I$ itself can be recovered as radical $\sqrt{I}$ by means of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz.
We give the projective version of the Nullstellensatz, as stated in \cite[section 5.3]{reid1988undergraduate}:

\begin{theorem}[Projective Nullstellensatz]
For a set $X$ of points in projective space $\proj^n_k$ define its ideal $\I(X) := \mkset{f \in k[x_0,..x_n]}{f(x_0,..x_n) = 0\,\forall [x_0:..x_n] \in X}$.
Then $\I$ and $\V$ are inclusion reversing and for ideals $J$ with $\V(J) \neq \emptyset$ we have $\I(\V(J)) = \sqrt{J}$.
$\V(J) = \emptyset$ holds iff $J \supset (x_0,..x_n)$.
\end{theorem}

We will now clarify what we mean by a geometric object.
\begin{definition}
A \emph{projective variety} $X$ is a closed subset of some projective space $\proj^n_k$ coming with an ideal $I$, such that $\V(I) = X$.
If the ideal $I$ is not specified, then it will be assumed to be $I=\I(X)$.
\end{definition}
Having defined what objects we consider, we need to say a word about what morphisms are.
\begin{definition}
Let $d \in \naturals$.
A morphism $\phi : X \to Y$ of projective varieties $X \subset \proj^n_k$, $Y \subset \proj^m_k$ is a function between sets $X$ and $Y$,
given by homogeneous polynomials $f_0,..f_m \in k[x_0,..x_n]$ of degree $d$ or 0, that is, $\phi([a_0:..a_n]) = [f_0(a_0,..a_n):..f_m(a_0,..a_n)]$.
We also demand the $f_i$ to have no common zero. \emph{Notation:} We can also write $\phi = (f_0,..f_m)$ as shorthand.
\end{definition}
Notice that such morphisms are continuous.
For more details refer to \cite[part I, lecture 1]{harris1992algebraic}.

\begin{example}
A \emph{hypersurface} is given by one equation $f=0$ for $f\in k[x_0,..x_n]$, and its set of points is $\V(f)$.
In case of $f$ being a linear form we call $\V(f)$ a \emph{hyperplane}.
A line is determined by $n-1$ $k$-linearly independent linear forms and a point by $n$ $k$-linearly independent linear forms.
As a set, a point indeed consists of precisely one point.
Intersections of hyperplanes are called \emph{linear spaces} \cite[example 1.1]{harris1992algebraic}.
\end{example}

\begin{proposition} $n$ hyperplanes $\V(h_1),..\V(h_n)$ in $\proj^n_k$ have precisely at least one common point of intersection.
If the $h_i$ are $k$-linearly independent, then the intersection of all the planes consists of precisely one point.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
To find a point lying on all $n$ hyperplanes amounts to solving a homogeneous system of $n$ linear equations in $n+1$ variables.
Such a system always has at least one non-zero solution.
The $h_i$ being linearly independent implies that the system of equations has full rank, so the solutions have dimension $(n+1) - n = 1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary} \label{corollarySimpleIntersect}
Setting $n=2$ an immediate consequence is that two lines in $\proj^2_k$ intersect.
Because lines are intersections of $n-1$ hyperplanes in $\proj^n_k$, we also deduce that lines always intersect with hyperplanes.
\end{corollary}

So far we have defined a line to be an intersection of hyperplanes, but of course we also want to understand a line as the unique intersection of such hyperplanes containing two distinct points.
We can obtain these results resorting to pure linear algebra, but to cut this short, we will use some more advanced concepts in the following discussion.

Let's fix a projective space $\proj^n_k$ ($n\geq 1$) and let $P=[p_0:..p_n]$ and $Q=[q_0:..q_n]$ be distinct points in $\proj^n_k$.
For two projectives varieties $X$,$Y$ any morphism $X \to Y$ has a closed image (\cite[theorem 1.10]{shafarevich1994basic}).
Clearly, the set $\{ \lambda P + \mu Q \}$ is the image of $\phi : X=\proj^1_k \to Y=\proj^n_k, [\lambda:\mu] \mapsto [\lambda p_0 + \mu q_0,..]$ hence it is closed.
Furthermore $\phi(X)$ cannot have dimension\footnote{for a definition of dimension refer to \cite[chapter 6]{shafarevich1994basic}} more than $\dim(\proj^1_k) = 1$.
One can see that $\phi(X)$ does not have dimension 0, having infinitely many points, do the dimension indeed is one.
To show that it is indeed a linear subspace, consider the vector space $S_1(P,Q)$ of all linear forms vanishing on $P$ and $Q$.
It has dimension $(n+1) - 2 = n-1$ and every $h \in S_1(P,Q)$ vanishes on all of $\phi(X)$ as $h(\lambda P + \mu Q) = \lambda h(P) + \mu h(Q) = 0$.
So $\phi(X)$ is contained in the line $\V(S_1(P,Q))$.

An easy corollary is
\begin{lemma} \label{lemmaLineOnSurface}
A hypersurface $\V(f)$ containing two points $P$ and $Q$ also contains the line $\overline{P,Q}$ if $f(\lambda P +\mu Q) = 0 \in k[\lambda,\mu]$.
\end{lemma}

If one wishes to, one can show by a completely analogous argument, that a plane is determined by three points $P,Q,R$ on it, such that they don't all lie on a line.
In that case the set of points of the plane is given by $\mkset{\lambda P + \mu Q + \nu R}{[\lambda:\mu:\nu] \in \proj^2_k}$ which is the image of a map $\proj^2_k \to \proj^n_k$ $(n\geq 2)$, hence it's dimension is $\leq 2$.
On the other hand, it contains the plane $\V(S_1(P,Q,R))$ (the intersection of all the hyperplanes through $P,Q,R$), so $\V(S_1(P,Q,R)) = \mkset{\lambda P + \mu Q + \nu R}{[\lambda:\mu:\nu] \in \proj^2_k}$ gives a plane.

\begin{remark}
Why are we working over an algebraically closed field?
It is known that the projective variety $\V(x^n + y^n - z^n), \,(n>0)$ has no rational points (I won't give a proof).
An even better known fact: $x^2 + z^2 = 0$ has no non-zero solutions over the reals.
To work comfortably we always want to have sufficiently many points on our varieties to work with and Hilbert's Nullstellensatz gives us this guarantee.
\end{remark}
